Welcome to Bamazon! 

This is a back-end app that mimics a storefront. Mysql is used to store the inventory. 

Mysql, inquirer, and console.table are required. 

Once you run the app, in the terminal it shows the products available in a table with their unique id, price, and inventory. The user is prompted to input the id that they would like to purchase then the quantity. The app then checks the database to ensure that there is sufficient inventory. If not, the user is again shown the table of products. If there is sufficient quantity, the user is shown their total and the inventory they purchased is subtracted from the Mysql database inventory. Throughout the process, the user is also given the option to exit.
